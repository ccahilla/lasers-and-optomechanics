    "# Intro to Lasers - Homework Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This overviews expectations for homework in *Lasers and Optomechanics*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color:#ff5555;\">You will need to complete the questions in this jupyter notebook and submit it via `gitlab`</span>**\n",
    "Instructions for submitting homework:\n",
    "1. `git clone` the [class github](https://github.com/ccahilla/lasers-and-optomechanics) repository to your computer.\n",
    "2. Make your own `github` or `gitlab` repository for submitting homeworks in this class.  You may call it `lasers-and-optomechanics-homework-solutions`.  You can keep it private between us or make it public, your choice.  My github and gitlab username are both `ccahilla`.\n",
    "3. Copy the jupyter notebook containing the homework `.ipynb` file from the github repository to your repository.\n",
    "4. Complete the homework questions in the jupyter notebook.  Be sure to `git commit` and `git push` your solutions often as your work through them.\n",
    "5. The homeworks will be due on Fridays at 5 pm.  Send me a link to your git committed assignment.  I will mostly be grading for completeness.\n",

    "#### `python`\n",
    "You will need to know `python` to be successful in this class.\\\n",
    "Part of the goal of this class will be to develop your coding ability, and create plots as to illustrate your analytic results.\n",
    "You will need to develop expertise in the following `python` packages:\n",
    "1. numpy\n",
    "2. matplotlib\n",
    "3. jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $\\LaTeX$\n",
    "Also, $\\LaTeX$ is required for this class.\\\n",
    "For most syntax, surround your math statements with dollar signs:\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\\$ y = m x + b \\$ $\\qquad \\rightarrow \\qquad y = m x + b$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `jupyter notebook`\n",
    "`jupyter` notebooks like this have multiple blocks called 'cells', that can be either `Code`, `Markdown`, or `Raw`.\\\n",
    "This one is `Markdown`, and so allows us to use LaTeX and other Markdown techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any cell can be run by hitting `Shift + Enter` at any time.\\\n",
    "If the cell is `Code`, the `python` code will be run.\\\n",
    "If the cell is `Markdown`, the markdown in the cell will be interpreted and displayed.\\\n",
    "This allows for quick interactive feedback on whether your code is working or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <span style=\"color: #ff9900;\">Homework Submission Expectations</span>\n",
    "Some questions will require you to do a calculation in `python`,\\\n",
    "others will require a plot to be produced and displayed via `matplotlib`,\\\n",
    "and still others will ask for a mathematical derivation.\\\n",
    "For the derivations, they may be done either by pencil and paper and scanned into in a `Markdown` cell,\n",
    "transcribed in $\\LaTeX$ in a `Markdown` cell,\n",
    "or directly in `sympy` in a `Code` cell.\n",
