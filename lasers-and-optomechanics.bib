	abstract = {This paper is a review of the theory-of laser beams and resonators. It is meant to be tutorial in nature and useful in scope. No attempt is made to be exhaustive in the treatment. Rather, emphasis is placed on formulations and derivations which lead to basic understanding and on results which bear practical significance.},

	abstract={This paper is an introduction to an elegant and powerful technique in modern optics: Pound-Drever-Hall laser frequency stabilization. This introduction is primarily meant to be conceptual, but it includes enough quantitative detail to allow the reader to immediately design a real setup, suitable for research or industrial application. The intended audience is both the researcher learning the technique for the first time and the teacher who wants to cover modern laser locking in an upper-level physics or electrical engineering course.},
