# Syllabus

In this course, we will overview the basics of optomechanics, lasers, and interferometers, 
with a focus on understanding optics lab components and gravitational wave detectors like Advanced LIGO.

1. Intro to Lasers
2. Plane Wave Mechanics and Interference
3. Interferometers
4. Gravitational Waves Detection
5. Geometric Optics
6. Transfer Functions

8. Control Systems

and more Special Topics.

### Goals
A key component of this course will be familiarizing yourself with the latest interferometer simulation tools,
as well as understanding them analytically.
To do this effectively, we will need to rely on modern technical tools.
The hope of creating these interactive jupyter notebooks is to allow students in *Lasers and Optomechanics* to become familiar with tools used by scientists in the field of gravtiational wave detection.

### Textbooks
We will be relying on several texts and some video overviews
The major texts we will rely on are
1. *Lasers* by Seigman {cite}`Siegman_1986` [Free eBook](https://opg-optica-org.libezproxy2.syr.edu/content/bookshelf/book/item/lasers)
2. *Fundamentals Of Interferometric Gravitational Wave Detectors* by Saulson {cite}`Saulson_2017` [Syracuse Library Link](https://search.syr.edu/discovery/search?query=any,contains,fundamentals%20of%20interferometric%20gravitational%20wave%20detectors%20&tab=Everything&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&sortby=date_d&vid=01SYU_INST:SYU&facet=frbrgroupid,include,9008347074956529785&lang=en&offset=0)
3. Some of the [*Feynman Lectures on Physics*](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)

Minor texts or articles will be clearly linked at the start of each lecture or homework as well.

### Evalulation
We'll have three major course components:
1. Homework
2. In-class Quizzes (every Wednesday)
3. End-of-year Special Topics Review Project by each student

The grade breakdown is as follows:
```{table} Grade breakdown for *Lasers and Optomechanics*
:name: table:grade_breakdown
:align: center

| **Component** | **Percent of Final Grade**        |
|---|---|
| Homework | 20\% |
| Quizzes | 40\% |
| Review Project | 40\% |
```
**Homeworks** will be due every week, in Jupyter Notebooks with questions that must be completed.

**Quizzes** will be a short in-class question reviewing the previous week's physics concept from lecture, readings, and homework.

The **End-of-year Review Project** will be to prepare a review in a Jupyter Notebook 
like the ones in this class about a topic in interferometry, lasers, optomechanics, or anything else related to the course.

### Videos
I have linked some useful optics videos in [](#table:videos).  
These are not required for class, but in some cases strongly recommended to quickly review course content.

## <span style="color: #9c9cff;">Prerequisites</span>

Students will be expected to have working knowledge of the following
1. Waves
2. Classical Mechanics
3. Complex Numbers
4. Differential Equations
5. Laplace Transforms
6. `python`

We will review topics as necessary, but previous exposure will be useful.
